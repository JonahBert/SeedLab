This repository is for the Mini Project, which integrates Computer Vision and Motor Control.
In this repo are different codes in Arduino, Python, and MATLAB, which implement a PI controller
on our robot to show a binary message that represents the quadrant in which an aruco marker is detected.
There is a MATLAB simulation of our motor, as well as well-defined functions that the Arduino code needs.
