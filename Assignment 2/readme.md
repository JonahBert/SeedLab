This folder contains all of the code and content used for Assignment 2. 
During the course of Assignment 2, our group completed multiple objectives. These objectives included capturing and storing an image on the Raspberry Pi, using Open CV to process images, detect markers, 
and determine the angle and distance to markers, using the Arudino IDE to download a program, explaining how the I2C protocol works, writing a program that implements I2C functions on the Raspberry Pi 
and Arduino, using I2C to commicate between the Raspberry Pi and Arduino, and using I2C to commmunicate with another device and the Raspberry Pi.

Py group completed four different tasks, in Task 1 the Pi sent a string to the Arduino, which led to the Arduino displaying a string of characters followed by ASCII codes. In Task 2 the user input a 
number between 0 and 100, which the Pi sent to the Arduino, leading the Arduino to add 100 to that number and sent it back to the Pi. The Pi then displayed the number on the LCD screen. In Task 3,
