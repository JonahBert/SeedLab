This folder contains all of the code and content used for the MiniProject. 
The purpose of the MiniProject is to detect an aruco marker in 4 different quadrants of the camera display.
Once we detect the quadrant the aruco marker is in, we display the position on the LCD screen which then tells the motor wheels to move in a specific way.

A short description of each piece of code is provided below:
